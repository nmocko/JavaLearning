# JavaLearning

These are my projects made during the process of learning the Java language.

## BattleShip

This is a battleship game for two players. The map has size 10x10, and each player has 10 ships. This game has to be run on two computers.

## Mobile Phone

This is a basic Mobile Phone simulation which allows users to manage contacts (add, search, delete and use) and writes messages.
